                    <h4><b>CLYW x One Drop YoYo's: The Summit</b></h4>
                    <p>In 2015 a canadian company named CLYW, and One Drop yoyo's collaborated to produce
                    a yoyo that represented both companies. The result was The Summit; in my humble opinion one of the 
                    finest mono-metal yoyo's ever sold... <a href='summit-yoyo.html'>read more</a>

                <h1 id = 'community'>The YoYo Community</h1>
                <p>I was shocked by how large the community of throwers is when I started out in the hobby.
                    There are a handful of facebook groups (I'm actively on this one<a href = 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/yoyoBST/'>The Yoyo BST & Talk</a>),
                    a subreddit (<a href = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Throwers/'>r/throwers</a>), and a substantial number
                    of forums that are very active. 
                    The overall attitude of the community is very positive. The yoyo players I've had the pleasure of meeting,
                    or talking to online have been pleasant, if not outright cheery. It's a shared passion, in my opinion.
                </p>

                <h2 id = 'brands'>Yoyo Brands!</h2>

                <h4>Boutique brands</h4>
                <p>From what I have learned there are a few different kinds of yoyo brands in general.
                    The first I would probably call either boutique, or artisenal. Companies like <a href = 'https://clyw.ca/'>CLYW</a>, <a href = 'https://onedropyoyos.com/'>One Drop</a>, 
                    <a href = 'https://www.mfdyoyo.com/'>MonkeyFingeR Designs</a>, and <a href = 'https://www.gsquaredyoyos.com/'>G-Squared</a> fall into this category. 
                    Generally speaking they yoyo's botique companies make are more artistic interpretations of the design principles, 
                    (arguably higher quality), and are made in batch runs (i.e. not mass produced). They tend to be more
                    expensive, but in my opinion it's worth the extra bit. (fun fact! The moto One Drop started with, and still maintains
                    is 'metal for all'. Meaning their goal is to make enough high quality metal yoyo's at an affordable price 
                    that anybody who wants one can get one.)
                </p>

                <h4>Mass produced</h4>
                <p>The other group of companies are mass-producers. Brands like <a href = 'https://yomega.com/'>Yomega</a>,
                    and <a href = 'https://shop.yoyoexpert.com/collections/plastic-yo-yos'>YoyoFactory</a> fall into this category.
                    I would hesitate to say they produce inferior quality, but also wouldn't put them on the same level as 
                    One Drop or MonkeyFingeR in those terms.
